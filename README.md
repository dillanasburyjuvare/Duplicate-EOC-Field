# duplicate-eoc-field README

An extension to find duplicate eocfields in your HTML markup

## Features

This extension uses Javascript to scan the document and find any duplicate eocfield tags in your current view.

For example if you have an eofield called 'position_name' and it is listed in your HTML like the following:

![Status Bar Message](duplicate-eoc-field/images/Animation.gif)


This message will appear on the right hand side of the status bar:

![Status Bar Message](duplicate-eoc-field/images/StatusBarMessage.png)


## Requirements

This extension is very lightweight and requires no additional dependencies.


## Release Notes

Initial release; everything works as it should
